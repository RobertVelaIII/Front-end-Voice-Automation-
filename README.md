# Callify - Front-End Repository

This is the front-end repository for Callify, an AI-powered phone automation platform. This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Structure

This repository contains only the front-end code for Callify. A separate back-end repository will be created to handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and integration with voice AI services. The front-end will communicate with the back-end via API calls once both components are developed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
